# LU Factorization with Partical Pivoting

This code was one of the hardest for me to solve. In this code we were tasked with writing a code then when given user inputs for a matrix to use LU factorization w/ partial pivoting to solve the given matrix. For this code we used Inputs:

* A- coefficient matrix 

Outputs 

* L- lower triangular matrix, with 1's along diagonals
* U- upper triangular matrix
* P- the pivot matrix 

From this we were able to decompose specic user inputted matrixs to see L, U, and P. This proved to be helpful when given a system of equations where we could use this to solve the equations in a faster manner.

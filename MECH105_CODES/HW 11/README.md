# False Position- Root Finding

For this particalar set of *MATLAB* codes we were tasked with using False Positioning to come up with roots. The False Position Code that is given in the folder was the algorithm that was used in order to estimate roots with False Positioning method. 

### *Inputs for the Code:

* func- the fuction being evaluated 
* x(l)- the lower guess 
* x(u)- the upper guess
* es- the desired relative error  (set at .0001%)
* maxit- the maximum number of iterations to use (set at 200) 


### *Outputs for the Code: 

* root- the estimated root location
* fx- the function evaluated at the root location
* ea- the approximate relative error (%) 
* iter- how many iterations were performed

After this code was written is was able to evaluate functions using False positioning to any desired es. I also learned that you can run sections of *MATLAB* code so you can see each iteration of the code being run. The second code that is included in this folder is the Root Finding problem that was given to us. This problem had a given function, mu, and included data like accleration of gravity.

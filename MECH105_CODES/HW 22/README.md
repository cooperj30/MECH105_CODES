# Simpsons 1/3 Algorithm

This *MATLAB* file is a big on. In class we learned of ways use numerical methods in order to solve for area under graph, or integration. One of the methods that we learned was Simpson's 1/3 Rule. For this function we were tasked with:

1. Using Correct Input Sizes 
2. Uniformity and Spacing in integration 
3. Using Correct Trapezoid Rule with 2 Data Points 
4. Using Correct Simpson's Rule with 3 Data Points 
5. Solving a Real problem with the given code. 

An important aspect of this code is the messages that are used inside of the script. Becuase Simpson's 1/3 rule is quite picky about what values are used, I had to include errors when the user choses data points and interations that are not able to be used. When this code is used correctly it is able to give a value of the estimation of area under the graph. One thing that I would have liked to include was a way to compare my anwser with the correct value of the problem in order to see *Absolute Percent Error*.

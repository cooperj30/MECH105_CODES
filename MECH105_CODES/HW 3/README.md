# Calculating Volume in a Tank

For this specific *MATLAB* code we were tasked with figuring out the volume of a tank when given specific parameters. Some included: 

| Height | Diameter 1 | Diameter 2|
|----|----|----| 
|20M | 46M | 25M| 

This code was a good example of marking out varibles and parameters before the actual calculating was needed. This script starts off with listing all of the knows, unknows, and calulated values. Then the code is able to break down this information and compute the volume in a tank. I personally like this script because this is a problem that has popped up in other classe, and then it does I am able to change the know values and caluate volume in any tank!
